to move slowly changing the layout of the room. As you examine the room
further you notice various posts around the room to which people are
chained. The firewalls seem to move in patterns that leave the poor
people directly in the path of the oncoming fire. The walls seem to creep
ever so slowly towards them. The people blister and scream as the fire gets
closer. Their deaths seem like minutes of agony and pain, and even as they
burst into flames they seem incapable of grasping the merciful attention of
death...

enchanting and horrifying fables of Hell begin to swirl around in your mind. 
The walls around you seem to be telling stories of past hero's and heroines 
who have ventured this far, to battle the Fallen Angel itself, only to never

What a digusting sight! The smell alone in this room is enough
to make you vomit. At your feet lie, 7 Angels, all brutually
dismembered. Thier wings have been tossed into the corner of the
room. It looks as though this might have been the Angels of 
{^Revelations {0that were sent to battle {!Satan{0 himself and cast him to
the lake of fire. Insesint laughter can be heard coming from the

Gathered at his feet are various demons, and alluring women engaged in
various Unholy acts of passion.  You close your eyes to the vulgarity,

Stanley's Magical Steeds~
This is the shop of Stanly. He used to be an old mage selling cursed
trinkets at the town of Solace. He has recently set up shop in Hell selling
magical figurines. Each figurine is in the shape of some sort of steed.
Some are recognizable and some are not. Rumor has it that Stanley made
a deal with a devil....so I guess his lease is up in seven years.....
