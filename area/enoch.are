Before you stands a city older then the mountains themselves.  Its
once proud walls stand before you, crumbling in the prevading elements.
Far to the North stands a Dark Castle, Past it on the Horizon you 
see two, twin towers.  A Bright beam dances wildly between the Spires.
You turn your attention to the city before you, The buzzing of the 
market fills your ears.

to reveal a a mural on the Ceiling, depiction mans fall from grace, and
The Asscension of Christ.  Rows of people stand in silence, praying,

"Enter The Arena"  a booming voice echos.  You can smell the dried 
blood caked on the walls of this room.  One Bloody competetor walks
slowly walks out of the Pit.  The other competetor is dragged out.
This is where all disputes are settled, if you have the stomach for it.
The only exit is to the west.
