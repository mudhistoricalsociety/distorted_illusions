{WWelcome To Lodoss!!{x~
Once, long ago, a war was waged by ancient gods.  The battle was fought
pitting the forces of evil against the forces of good.  Dragons and beast,
humans and demi-humans all fought for the glory of thier gods.  One by one
the gods fell till only Marfa, mother Goddess of Creation, and Kardis,
Goddess of Destruction, were left standing.  As their battle raged on, the
ground quaked and the oceans rolled.  At the climax of their final battle,
The land was spilt and what was formed has come to be known as Lodoss, The
Accursed Island.  Both goddesses where struck down at once and the war
ended.  That was a thousand years ago and now Lodoss remains.

sa the neighboring villages of barbarians, who where tired of being ruled
sa by wizards of Kastuul, revolted and attacked Kastuul.  By sheer numbers,
sa They started to overrun the kingdom.  As an act of desperation, the wizards
sa used their magic to enslave five ancient dragons and tasked them with
sa protecting artifacts of great magical power.  Knowing of her imminent doom, 
sa Karla used powerful and ancient magic to trap her soul and place it in her
sa circlet.  She then went into the battle where she was killed.  Her circlet
sa was picked up by her killer and her soul possessed the man.  Through these 
sa means, she has lived for over 500 years.  Defeat her if you must, but be
