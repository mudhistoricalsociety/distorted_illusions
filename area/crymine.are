Standing Over The Expanse~
You are standing on top of a large cliff face that overlooks what appears
to be an enormous underground city constructed of a silvery and copper red
looking type of material.  It must be mined from somewhere in this huge
underground expanse.  The city appears to go on for miles, and seems to sit
in an enormous crater, with this large cliff face running all along the
perimeter to make a crude oval shape.  There are tunnels leading into the
cliff and down to the city below, but it is difficult to determine what
tunnels go where.
