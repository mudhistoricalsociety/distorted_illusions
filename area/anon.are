The Temple of Anon~
You are standing before the Temple of Anon, a truly majestic structure
constructed from pure marble. Tall Corinthian columns flank an impressive
set of bronze-bound oaken portals, which are never shut save in times of
trouble. Through these doors you can glimpse the majestic interior of the
Temple. Atop the pillars rests a plinth bearing an incredibly well-crafted
frieze which depicts the Immortals of RoT at work creating the World.
A broad, tree-lined avenue called "Victory Parade" runs past the Temple.

The Interior of the Temple~
Marvelously sculpted likenesses of the Immortals of RoT line the aisle
of this sanctuary of the Gods. Tapestries on the walls depict their victories
over their enemies, and many of the treasures they acquired on such campaigns
are also displayed here. There is a magnificent altar fashioned of purest
obsidian to the north, chased with gold and partially covered with white
cloth. Behind this stands the healer, who will tell you how he can help you
if you look at him.

The Bar~
You have entered a seedy bar full of low-lifes of the lowest common
denominator. A greasy bartender serves drinks to the sullen patrons, while
in the corner a couple of sailors are roughing up an Elf who refused to pay
up upon losing the last hand in poker.

You have entered a Martial Arts Dojo devoid of all furniture or decoration
save several practice mats and some wooden weapons hung on hooks attached
to the walls. Several students, clad in white Ghis practice basic Karate
punches and Judo holds with each other, under the watchful eye of their
instructor. The Guildmaster resides to the north, and the Guild relaxation
chambers are to the south.

The Relaxation Room~
Rigid and disciplined as they are, the members of this Guild don't spend much
time loafing around. However, when the mood takes them, few can outdrink them
whatever the beverage, and as the mood can take them quite frequently when
their usage of their mental disciplines drains their mana, this place was
constructed.

The Vampires' Bar~
Not many Vampires reside in Anon, so this place is usually empty. Combine
this with the fact that Mind Flayers have a reputation of sucking out and
eating the brains of other sentient species, and you'll probably understand
why there are very few non-Vampires in this place at any particular time...
Like all mana-users, Vampires have a need to be constantly intoxicated, and
what better place to do this than in their Guild Bar?

room has no need for any. If you don't know what to do, try looking at the
purple-skinned, tentacle-mawed instructor and see what he has to think...

You have entered the local chippy. Your nostrils are almsot immediately
assailed by a pleasant aroma- it's amazing how good hot fat smells, isn't
it? You see a portly Italian standing behind a large glass counter full of
fried food. It certainly smells a lot better than it looks. A customer
standing next to you says- "It looks a lot better than it tastes...". Most
of the food has probably been sitting under those hot lights for a couple
of hours. The only thing you can be reasonably sure of is the chips.
By the way, EVERYTHING is fried.

The writing says-

"Now my charms are all o'erthrown, and what strength I have's mine own;
 which is most faint; now, 'tis true, I must be here confined by you, or
 send to Naples. Let me not, since I have my dukedom got and pardon'd the
 deceiver dwell in this bare siland by your spell; but release me from my
 bands with the help fo your good hands. Gentle breath of yours my sails
 must fill, or else my project fails, which was to please. Now I want spirits
 to enforce, art to enchant; and my ending is despair, unless I be reliev'd
 by prayer, which pierces so that it assaults mercy itself and frees all
 faults. As you from crimes would pardon'd be, let your indulgence set me
 free". (The Tempest, Epilogue)

You are heading along the huge northern wall of the City of Anon. This wall
extends for at least twice the distyle of the east and west walls,
protecting the vulnerable northern aspect of the city from the constant
attacks by warring raiders from the northern plains. Peering about, you see
little of note, save the dark stretch of Mirkwood. Who knows what adventures
may be found in there...?

because there has never been an assault from the south on the city, mostly
due to the presence of the southern ocean, which lies just outside this
wall. You smile, relax and enjoy the walk.

of a bright red corvette which lies upside down providing shelter for hapless

that escaped Thatcherism under red skies clouded with gray raindrops the size
of refectories that have been filled with disposable lunch bags made in a tiny
nation somewhere near Angkor and have been left to rot as a result of rabid
imperialism and soothsayers telling numberless lies to irritated masses who
are unhappy but don't know why.

You see a tea party staffed by villainous serfs with large axes who promptly
decapitate anyone stupid enough to complain about the service except for a
large hare wearing a silly hat with the price tag still attached whom they
seem to revere and you whom they seem to ignore.

"Hey! I didn't order this!"

Hot air balloons crowded with curious fruit bats soar high below the bottoms
of small belfries full of bats which seem to annoy the hunchbacked errand
boy named Quasimodo to no end as he constantly chases them out while wearing
daisy chains and dancing around a maypole he stole from some kids in another
land.

A mythical hero strides forth from the mist that divides us all and declares
himself ruler of this fell domain, and is suddenly covered with a pile of
leaves so massive it obscures the sun, and then when the wind blows the leaves
away he is gone to some other realm.

A vaudeville act is placed upon a central stage near a large Peavey amp which
blares out Caliope music to the delight of hundreds of interested fans of
strange 1950's science fiction movies; you spot Yaegar in the crowd, and
lurch toward him in an attempt to force him to end this madness, but he grins
and disappears.
