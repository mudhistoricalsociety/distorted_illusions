    To whom it may concern,

        Merc Industries has installed a new no-rent save and quit
        system.  Apparently one can now save and quit at any time
        from anywhere inside a town or out.  My services here are
        no longer required.

Kate's Diner~

the doorway of the diner.  No greasy spoons to be seen here-- the
booth walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood,
rescued from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards
carved and painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some
musical or other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the
wonderful smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window
looks out over the Midgard River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock
and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south
returns you to Austral Square.
On most days you will find Kate here, testing a batch of stew or brewing
a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for your arrival
Pull up a chair, perhaps play a game, and take time out to talk.

Vampire's Crypt~
This crypt is filled wall-to-wall with coffins, some open, some tossed
haphazardly against the wall, some perfectly undisturbed.  It's so dark
here even elves would have trouble seeing clearly.  A well in the middle
of the floor leads down into darkness.  Vile smells waft from the depths.

The House of Fetish~
You are in a large room that reminds you more of a dungeon than a shop.
Undescribable contraptions hang from the ceiling and walls, and the floor
is littered with ropes and leg cuffs.
To the east and west are counters with sales clerks, and to the north
is a large brass door.

Nemesis' Private Dungeon~
You've stumbled upon Nemesis' private chamber.  You had better not let
her catch you here, or you may never want to leave.  Leather straps
hang down from the walls, some of which are still occupied.
There is a huge canopied waterbed with mirrors over the bed.
The bed has black satin sheets and five or six huge feather pillows.
Leather restraints fall down off the four corners of the bed.
