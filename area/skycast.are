shaylious elf dark~
Shaylious~
A dark elf is pacing around his cell, a small light glowing about his fingertips.
~
Her once proud dark {Bblue{X cloak is now in tatters, and very faded. It
does however still flow down to the backs of her ankles, half covering her worn
dark black leather boots. Blue hair spills out from what is left of the hood on
her robe, tumbling down well past her shoulders to around the small of her back.
The most captivating thing about her though is her eyes; violet, with pupils as
small as pinpricks. They seem to be dancing around, always with a hint of amusement
behind them.

monument~
This is a monument dedicated to the people who sacrificed their time and
energy to write code and/or build areas solely for the enjoyment of others. 
These are the names of the Immortals through out the years, there have been
so many that if any are forgotten i apologize, it is hard to remember everyone. 
Tas, Kefka, Tien, Skyntil, Lucifer, Gavorkian, Raistlyn, Anonymous, Jair,
Fesdor, Shayla, Bree, Dusk, Sturm, Ishamael, Snaek, Zeddicus, Callin, Pious,
Digaaz, Zellie, Roq.
I'm sure there are others i have forgotten, and one i left out on purpose, but
Asgard would not be what it is today without the fore mentioned people. There
will always be others to continue on with the work once the old guard and the
semi-new are gone, continuing to add to the history of our beloved world.
We bring our dreams to life here because we know that this World will always
continue on, and continue to be a place where people will enjoy themselves.

Before a Giant Stone Carved Staircase~
The view from this place is surreal; a towering mountain stands before
you, white as the powder snow. It seems to have no end in sight, save for
a small glimmer near the very top that could be a structure of some kind.
There is a large staircase cut into the very rock of the mountain, although
it looks steep, small, and at times, downright dangerous, however it does
look negotiable.

A Crossroads~
This is a large crossroad that intersects a three-way intersection in
the road. A large tower can be seen in the far distance to the north, but
seems to have an evil vibe being thrown off of it in all directions. There
are more rolling hills and plains to the north, while the west path seems
to favor a dark, haunting, and forbidding forest. The very sky to the west
seems to have darkened several shades for what it ought to be for this time
of day. A large fountain sits in the center of the square, flanked on the
right side by a large granite bench.

The Western Way~
This is the western way path, a path that has grown in both
myths and legend over the course of the last few hundred years or
so. These parts are rumored to be haunted by all sorts of evil things
out of nightmares. The forest presses in close around on both sides
of the road, giving it a gloominess that adds to the atmosphere.

Into The Ghost Town~
Walking along this dusty road, a chill runs throughout the entire
area, seemingly dropping the outside temp to almost freezing. The road
appears to be ancient, and rarely used, at least by those with feet.
The road continues to the north and the south.

The Ghost Town~
This appears to be an abandoned building that has not seen any use
for a very long time. There are cobwebs hanging all along the ceiling
and the walls, with dust covering the floor so perfectly it seems that
nobody has walked in here for a very long time. The walls are painted
a black color, with a few splatters or red here and there in a substance
that looks to be blood. The only exit is west.

Inside a hollowed out tree~
Inside this hollowed out tree, it becomes obvious that a very powerful
type of magic has made the inside twenty times the size of the tree that
it inhabits. The walls go up for what seems like miles, and are made up
of a blindly white marble, with small veins of green emeralds running up
and down at seemingly random places. A huge monument is standing in the
center of the room, and is obviously the center piece and main purpose
of the room. It is a towering piece of green and black marble, glimmering
in the soft light of the room. A large plaque is at the base of the monument.
There appears to be a small hallway leading towards the east, with a closed
door to the south. There is a hall for Mortal Records to the east.

Hall of Records~
This hall is very similar to the last chamber, the walls are made up of the
same marble like substance, going up about twenty feet into the air. Three
rather large chandeliers are hanging from the top of the ceiling in successive
order, with the two smaller lights flanking the larger of the three. A large
monument is sitting in the center of the room, and is obviously the reason for
this room's existence. The only exit is to the west.
