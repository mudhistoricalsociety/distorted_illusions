0 'CONJURE WRATH'~
Syntax: Cast 'conjure wrath' <victim>

Conjurers have developed a magic like no other wizards, the conjuring of
physical energies to aid them. A conjurer but needs to hold a certain item
and begin chanting the correct spell and their enemies will be smitten down.

Conjuring Wrath can have several effects depending on what the conjurer
holds. The most common and well known are balls of pulsing energy, sickly
knives from Hell, spinning shuriken, and fiery boulders of death. It has
been heard of that the spell backfires and a rubber chicken is conjured
which will attack the conjurer (This occurance is rare).

The most common items that conjurers will want to get a hold of for this
spell are anything that have to do with "light", special powders and herbs.
In the future more items with special effects will undoubtely be discovered.

(NOTE: This spell is in a test phase. Report any bugs to the immortals.)

/******************************************\
                  **  Immortal Laws of Distorted Illusions  **
                  \******************************************/
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Heed by these rules, and your immortality will remain unjeopardized.
               Please relate any questions to Tas
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1) When question or punishing mortals, please do so in private,
   preferably the corner, as it prevents them from creating an
   uprising using tells.
 
2) Do NOT use snoop for no reason at all. If you need to check
   something of theirs, and they are aware of it, then do so.
   Permission to use snoop is also granted if the victim has
   any offensives.
{x
3) If mortals are bugging you, give them a warning. If they persist,
   punish them according to the spamming punishments. If they are
   bugging you within reason, and are just pissing you off, there's
   a command called forget, that work's wonders.
 
4) Never disagree in front of mortals. This one's a given. Use
   tells or immtalk.
{x
5) No helping your own mortals under any circumstances.
{x
6) Do not, under any circumstances, go behind, or try to overrule
   any other immortals. This will be punished severely.
{x
7) Be patient and do what has to be done.
{x
8) Do not mess with PK in any way.
 
9) Do not kill mortals for ANY reason, except for punishment. If they
   ask to be slain because they've worn eq they cannot remove, just
   cast heat metal upon them. It works wonderously.
{x
10) Do not kill shopkeepers or peoples pets for any reason.
{x
11) Do not do corpse retrievals for mortals, unless they died while
    linkdead.
 
12) Transport people out of areas if they are utterly stuck, or they
    have been teleported into a new area.
{x
13) Do not give out eq.
{x
14) Do not RENAME people.  Period.  Unless you have special permission.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
                        That is all for now.

-1 lead~
Syntax: lead
 
The ability of Paladins to vindicate the just and punish the wicked is
near legendary.  The skill of leading comes naturally to them, and those
who are in their party look to them for support and courage.
 
As the ability to inspire others can be tiring, a toll of 300 moves and
200 mana are taxed upon the Paladin upon his efforts.  All classes may attempt
to lead, but as a warning, they probably will not be very good at it.
The natural charisma of a Paladin is required.

102 GUIDELINES~
The following are helps which further the detail of the guidelines.
 
AREA-STANDARDS
MOB-STANDARDS
OBJ-STANDARDS
ROOM-STANDARDS
SHOP-STANDARDS
~

-1 'RACE HELP' 'RACE' 'RACES'~
Type help for information on specific races.
 
Different races have different starting statistics, and also different 
stat maximums for magic items and training. 
 
Creation points increase the amount of experience it takes to gain a level. 
For more information, see the help files for each race (i.e. 'help dwarf') 
~

-1 DWARF DWARVES~
Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great 
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity. 
They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long  
lifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor 
mages or thieves.   
 
Dwarves are very resistant to poison and disease, but cannot swim, and so 
are very vulnerable to drowning.  They recieve the berserk skill for free 
(if warriors), and can see in the dark with infravision.
~

-1 HIGH-ELF HIGH-ELVES ELVES HIGHELF HIGHELVES~
Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build. 
They lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are far more
agile, both in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have
at best fair talent as warriors or priests.  Of all the elven races,
High-elves are the most commonly encountered.  Elves resist charm spells
most effectively, due to their magical nature.  Elves are notoriously hard
to spot, and so elven warriors and thieves recieve the sneak and hiding
automatically.  They may see in the dark with infravision.  
~

-1 SYLVAN-ELF SYLVAN-ELVES SYLVANELVES SYLVANELF~
Sylvan Elves or wood elves as they also are known, descended from the
same stock as other elves.  However, they prefer to live a more pimitive
lifestyle, more in touch with their roots in the primeval forests they have
made their homes.  They are geared toward simple survival, and they
concentrate on their environment rather than on philosophical debates and
the study of magic.  Sylvan elves enjoy the beauty of a singing bird, the
patterns of an intricate spider web, and their own practice of tattooing. 
They are the most temperamental and emotional elves.  Sylvan elves are more
muscular than other elves, and their complexions are darker.  They have
yellow to coppery red hair and brown eyes, though some rare cases of hazel
or blue eyes are known.  Any sylvan elf born with hazel or blue eyes is
considered a good omen for the tribe, believed to be destined for personal
greatness.  Sylvan elves normally dress in browns and greens, the better to
blend in with the forest.  
~

-1 GREY-ELF GREY-ELVES GREYELF GREYELVES~
Grey elves are considered the most noble and reclusive of elvenkind,
devoting time to improving their minds.  Also known as the faerie, this race
has withdrawn from the world around them, stepping forth only to combat
great evils.  To some - even other elves - this retiring natue makes grey
elves seem alof and uncaring.  Indeed, the faerie can be haughty, disdaining
contact with their cousins and considering themselves to be the highest,
purest, most noble form of elf.  Tall and slender, grey elves have amber or
violet eyes and silver or pale golden hair.  They prefer to dress in white,
silver, or golden yellow with cloaks of dark tones such as deep blue or
purple.  
~

-1 DARK-ELF DARK-ELVES DROW DARKELF DARKELVES~
The dark elves, also known as drow, live underground. Nearly all of them are evil, and they
have used their cunning to become masters of much of the UnderDark. Most intelligent creatures
shun them. In many ways, dark elves are the twisted, corrupt visions of their above-ground relatives.

Drow have jet black skin, the better to hide their movement underground. And they tend to be shorter
than other elves. The only other physical difference drow exhibit is their eyes, which glow a feral
red - evidence, perhaps, of the hatred that burns in their hearts and minds.
~

-1 FIRE-GIANT FIRE-GIANTS FIREGIANTS~
Fire giants are brutal, ruthless, and militaristic.
They are tall, but squat, resembling huge dwarves. An adult male is
18 feet tall, has a 12 foot chest, and weighs about 7,500 pounds.
Fire giants have coal black skin, flaming red or bright orange hair, and
prognathous jaws that reveal dirty ivory or yellow teeth. They can live to
be 350 years old. They are immune to fire, and vulnerable to cold.

They start the game with 7 creation points.
They make awesome warriors, and good vampires, but terrible mages.
They start the game with bash, fast healing, and dual wield. 
~

-1 FROST-GIANT FROST-GIANTS FROSTGIANTS~
Like all evil giants, frost giants have a reputation for crudeness and
stupidity.  This reputation is deserved, but frost giants are crafty
fighters.  Frost giants have muscular, roughly human builds.  The typical
adult male is 21' tall and weighs about 8,000 pounds.  Females are slightly
shorter and lighter, but otherwise identical to males.  Frost giants have
snow-white or ivory skin.  Their hair is blue or dirty yellow, with matching
eyes.  They can live to be 250 years old.  They are immune to cold, but
vulnerable to fire.  
~

-1 STORM-GIANTS STORMGIANTS~
Storm Giants are gentle and reclusive.  They are usually tolerant of
others, but can be very dangerous when angry.  Storm Giants resemble
well-formed humans of gargantuan proportions.  Adult males and females are
about 26' tall, and weigh about 15,000 pounds.  Storm giants have pale,
light green or (rarely) violet skin.  Green-skinned storm giants have dark
green hair and glittering emerald eyes.  Violet-skinned storm giants have
deep violet or blue-black hair with silvery gray or purple eyes.  Storm
giants can live to be 600 years old.  Storm giants are immune to lightning
and electricity.  
~

-1 PIXIE PIXIES~
Pixies are very much like the elves...and share with them a vulnerability 
to iron weapons.  They also share the nature-loving attitude and peaceful 
demeanor, but beyond this pixies reach an extreme.  They are extremely 
magical creatures which, unlike elves, fly everywhere they go.  Their 
wings are fairly redundant, as they don't really use them to fly.  It's 
the sheer magical nature of a pixie that gives it it's special qualities. 
 
They are a race of very small size, and because of their inquisitive 
nature and mental power, tend also to be tinkerers and sometimes 
pranksters.  While a pixie may be thousands of years old, almost all 
of them act like human children... 
~

-1 HALFLING HALFLINGS~
Halflings are a quiet folk who like to keep to themselves, and are not 
often seen filling the role of an adventurer.  They would much rather 
sit complacently by a fireplace enjoying a good book, good drink, and 
good conversation.  They are, however, very adept thieves, and have the 
mental capabilities to be quite powerful mages.  They are about half 
as tall as the average human, thus the name halfling.  Because of this 
small size and the fact that most devices are built to human proportions, 
halflings are masters at lockpicking, disarming traps, and jewel craft. 
They also have very easy access to pockets, and there is no door a 
halfling can not open and slip through with the utmost of silence. 
~

-1 HALFORC HALFORCS~
Halforcs are a cross between humans and orcs, dwarves and orcs, or sometimes 
even giants and orcs.  These various combinations are almost always the result 
of an orc raid on the habitation of one of those other races, and each type of 
halforc is just as mean and hearty as the other.  They are also very agile, 
and born athletes, however seldom is a halforc found that can even read or 
speak coherently.  They are quite literally dumber than bricks, but there is 
no more fearsome fighter around. 
 
A halforc is a warrior, and if a halforc is not a warrior, then that halforc 
is useless.  They can fight, and when it suits them they can also sleep, eat, 
and fornicate, but that's it. 
~

-1 HALFOGRES HALF-OGRES~
This hybrid comes from ogre and human parents. They average 7'-8' tall,
have ruddy complextions, dark hair, and dark eyes. They look like 
huge humans.
~

-1 GOBLIN GOBLINS~
Goblins are almost universally shunned because they are almost all natural 
criminals, cutthroats, and killers.  Every crime boss or thief master is a 
goblin, with very few exceptions.  They are extremely thrifty, known to 
argue over a single silver piece, and will drop water in the desert before 
dropping money. Goblins have diabolical minds, and few torture devices can 
be named which a goblin did not think up.  They are extremely smart and also 
have a knack for survival.  Stealth comes naturally to them, and their dusky 
grey to green, sometimes even blue or black, skin tones make them hard to 
spot at night. 
 
Goblins are not really warlike, and don't really appreciate overt combat. 
It's not their style.  A goblin would much rather satisfy its sadistic needs 
through thievery or betrayal than through honorable combat. 
~

-1 HALFELF HALFELVES~
Halfelves are a cross between a human and an elf, usually due to the fact 
that human armies sometime make raids on elf lands. Halfelves are very 
nearly human, although they tend to be a bit more thoughtful, and less 
physically powerful.  Unfortunately they are also more bitter, and much 
more aloof than either the most secretive elf or the most secluded human 
hermit.  They see themselves as unwelcome in either elf or human society 
and as a result tend to lead solitary lives as wandering adventurers who 
follow no real creed. 
 
A halfelf is a natural loner, and most of them are rangers or druids, 
communing with the nature that they love much as the elves do. 
They have much better eyesight than humans, due to their elven ancestry, 
but unlike elves are more inquisitive about the world around them, much 
as humans are.   
~

-1 AARAKOCRA~
Aarakocra are a race of intelligent bird-men that live among 
the highest mountain peaks. The average aarakocra stands about
five feet tall and has a wing span of twenty feet. Halfway 
along the edge of each wing is a hand with three human-sized 
fingers and an opposable thumb. An elongated fourth finger 
extends the length of the wing and locks in place during fight.
 
The hands cannot grasp while flying, but are nearly as useful 
as human hands when an aarakocra is perched and its wings 
folded back. Their powerful legs end in four sharp talons 
that can unlock and fold back to reveal another pair of 
functional hands.
 
These humanoids have hollow, fragile bones. Their faces 
combine the features of both parrots and eagles. They have 
gray-black beaks and black eyes. Plumage colour varies, but 
males generally have red, orange, and yellow colouration, 
while females tend toward brown and gray.
 
Aarakocra live in small tribes which control hunting 
territories and share a communal nest. The eldest
male serves as leader, the second oldest as shaman.
 
Because of their eyesight, Aarakocra can detect hidden and can see far off in the distance.
~

-1 GNOME GNOMES~
Gnomes are to dwarves what pixies are to elves.  That is to say, they are 
smaller, smarter, less-strong cousins.  Where dwarves are known for their 
mental dullness but great wisdom, gnomes are known for quick minds and a 
very analytical nature.  They are nowhere near as strong or hearty as 
dwarves are, but are much the same, being creatures of earth who can't 
swim (and thus drown easily like dwarves) and have eyes attuned to seeing 
in the dark.  Where a dwarf would see a mine shaft and it's glittering 
jewels, though, a gnome notices the girders and struts and supports within 
the mine and contemplates ways to make them better.  Gnomes love technology, 
metallurgy, and any other form of science.  This makes them natural mages, 
possessing mental powers that rival elves.  They are not, however, a stealthy 
race like elves, goblins, or halflings.  They are engineers, architects, 
artisans, and sometimes workers of great magicks. 
~

-1 DRACONIAN DRACONIANS~
The draconians are a fearsome race, and almost as secretive as the avians. 
Like the avians, they can fly, and come from some not-so-well-known place 
far away.  Unlike any other race though, draconians are not mammalian. 
They more closely resemble lizards, snakes, and especially dragons. 
They tower over even giants in size, reaching over 12 feet in height, with 
leathery wings that can stretch to over 30 feet when extended, and can fold 
up neatly on the back, causing no real hindrance in movement.  The sheer 
size of a draconian DOES, however, cause problems, because most things in 
the world are built with human size in mind.  Draconians are very strong, 
and tougher even than dwarves.  Unlike most races that reach such large 
proportions, they retain a keen mind, and make good mages as well as 
warriors.  Because of their strange biology, and some degree of reptilian 
nature, draconians are immune to almost all poisons and plagues. 
~

-1 CENTAUR CENTAURS~
Centaurs are woodland beings who shun the company of men.  They dwell in 
remote, secluded glades and pastures.  The appearance of a centaur is 
unmistakable: they have the upper torso, arms, and head of a human being, 
and the lower body of a large, powerful horse. 
~

-1 KENKU KENKUS~
Kenku are bipedal, humanoid birds that use their powers to annoy and 
convience the humand and demihuman races.  The typical kenku resembles 
a humanoid hawk wearing human clothing.  Kenku have both arms and wings. 
The wings are usually folded across the back and may be mistaken at a 
distance for a very large backpack.  Height ranges from 5 to 7 feet. 
The feathers are predominantly brown with white underfeathers and face 
markings.  The eyes are a brilliant yellow. 
~

-1 MINOTAUR MINOTAURS~
Minotaurs are either cursed humans or the offspring of minotaurs and 
humans.  They usually dwell in underground labyrinths, for they are not 
confused in these places, which gives them an advantage over their prey. 
Minotaurs are huge, well over 7 feet tall, and quite broad and muscular. 
They have the head of a bull but the body of a human male.  Their fur is 
brown to black while their body colouring varies as would a normal normal 
human's.  Clothing is minimal, usually a loin cloth or skirt. 
~

-1 KENDER~
Kender are mini-humans, standing about 4-5' tall.  They are natural
thieves, but don't call them that, you might get quite a surprise.  They
have the natural curiousity of a child, and know no property values. 
Anything in their family is considered an heirloom if it is in the house for
over a week.  Their natural weapon is a hoopak, or a dagger, if one isn't
available.  Their theiving skills are the best of all the races.  
~

-1 AEGIR~
His name is connected with the word for water.  He is also called Hler. 
Aegir was the god of the seashore or ocean, and called the ruler of the sea
by Snorri.  He was a personification of the ocean, be it good or evil.  He
caused storms with his anger and the skalds said a ship went into "Aegir's
wide jaws" when it wrecked.  Guerber states that Aegir was crowned with
seaweed and always surrounded by nixies and mermaids while in his hall.  He
was one of the Vanir a nd a giant.  His father was Mistarblindi
[Mist-Blind], and his brother, Logi [Fire].  Aegir's wife (and sister) was
Ran and they lived under the sea by the island Hlesey.  Ran and Aegir had
nine daughters who were the waves -- all of their names are poetic names for
waves.  Aegir brewed ale for the gods after Thor brought him a big enough
kettle.  Every winter the gods would drink beer at Aegir's home.  He was,
therefore, famed for his hospitality.  Gold was put onto the floor of the
hall to provide light, instead of having a fire.  Gold is therefore called
Aegir's fire.  The cups in Aegir's hall were always full, magically
refilling themselves.  Aegir had two servants in his hall, Fimafeng [Handy]
and Eldir [Fire-Kindler].  According to Lee Hollander, Aegir's function as
the gods' ale brewer was suggested by the ocean's foam.  After the death of
Balder, the gods gathered for a feast in Aegir's hall.  Loki showed up and
insulted everyone (this is told in Lokasenna in the Poetic Edda).  The gods
couldn't do Loki harm in the hall since it was a sanctuary where no violence
could be committed.  Aegir was also referred to by the name of Gymir [the
Blinder] (the name of Gerd's father -- it is not known if they are one and
the same).  Sailors feared Aegir, and thought he would sometimes surface to
destroy ships.  Early Saxons made human sacrifices to a god of the sea,
possibly connected with Aegir.  
~

-1 EIR~
A goddess of healing, considered the best doctor.  She taught her art to
women who were the only physicians in ancient Scandinavia.  
~

-1 FORSETI~
God of justice.  He is the son of Balder and Nanna.  His name means
"presiding one" and in The Poetic Edda, it says he is "the god that stills
all strife."  His home is Glitnir [shining].  
~

-1 FREY~
God of weather and fertility.  He ruled over the land of the light elves,
Alfheim.  He was the son of Njord and Njord's sister, and the brother of
Freya.  His step-mother was Skadi.  To make peace, the Aesir and Vanir
exchanged hostages.  He, along with Njord and Freya, were sent by the Vanir
to dwell with the Aesir.  He owned the ship Skidbladnir which was made for
him by dwarves.  It could sail on the land, sea, or through the air.  It was
large enough to hold all the gods, yet could be folded up and fit into a
pocket.  He also owned a chariot drawn by two boars, Gullinbursti and
Slidrugtanni.  He could ride Gullinbursti [golden-bristled] through the sky.
It was made by dwarfs for Loki to give to Frey.  His name means "Lord" and
it is thought that he was at one time the consort of his sister Freya
[Lady].  His wife was Gerd, a beautiful giantess who he fell in love with
when he espied her from Odin's throne.  He sent his servant, Skirnir, to win
her for him.  For this task, Frey lent Skirnir his sword which "swings
itself if wise he who wields it" and his horse.  After Skirnir's threatening
of her, Gerd agreed to give herself to Frey in nine nights at the forest
Barri.  At the Ragnarok, Frey will be killed by the fire giant Surt.  Also
known as Yng, Frey is named as the progenitor of the swedish royal family. 
There was a statue of Frey in the temple at Uppsala in Sweden, the center of
his cult.  
~

-1 FREYA~
Goddess of love, fertility, war, and wealth.  Originally one of the
Vanir.  She was the daughter of Njord, and the sister of Frey.  Her
daughter, by Od, is named Hnoss who is so beautiful that whatever is
valuable and lovely is named "treasure", after her.  She lived in Folkvang
[battlefield] and each day chose half of the slain warriors to split with
Odin.  She had a husband named Od, whom she somehow lost and cried golden
tears for.  Many believe Od is Odin.  Her chariot was drawn by cats and she
owned the precious Brisings' necklace, which she slept with four dwarves to
acquire.  She also owned a feather coat which she could use to fly between
the worlds.  After she went to live with the Aesir as a hostage, she taught
them -- including Odin -- seidr.  Some sources say Friday is named after
her.  
~

-1 FRIGG~
Goddess of marriage.  She is the wife of Odin, and Friday is named for
her (according to some).  Her abode was called Fensalir [The Ocean Halls]. 
She weaved the clouds.  
~

-1 HEL~
Daughter of Loki and the giant Angurboda.  She is the sister of Fenrir
(Fenris-wolf) and Jormungand (Midgard serpent).  She is the goddess of the
underworld.  Her realm was Niflheim and her hall, Elvidnir [misery].  She
was described as half white and half black.  
~

-1 JORD~
Earth goddess. Mother of Thor and Frigg. 
~

-1 LOKI~
A giant.  He became a member of the Aesir when Odin made Loki his blood
brother.  He is the god of mischief, a trickster, and very cunning.  After
causing the death of Balder, he was bound by the gods until the Ragnarok, at
which time, he will be freed.  There are quite a few sites dealing with Loki
including a wonderful on-line essay by Johannes Persson, an article by Eric
A.  Anderson regarding Loki's offspring, and the Loki Cult Web Page.  
~

-1 NJORD~
God of the wind and sea, father of Frey and Freya.  He is a member of the
vanir and his home is Noatun.  His wife was the giantess Skadi.  As
compensation for the death of her father Thjatsi, the gods decided to let
her pick a husband from among them -- one catch, she had to pick her new
husband based only on the appearance of his feet.  She picked Njord by
mistake, assuming his feet belonged to Balder.  Njord and Skadi could not
agree on where to live.  She didn't like his home, and he didn't like her's,
so they split up.  She was associated with skiing and hunting.  
~

-1 ODIN~
Leader of the Aesir.  Odin had a myriad of names including Allfather,
Ygg, Bolverk [evil doer], and Grimnir.  He also had many functions including
being a god of war, poetry, wisdom, and death.  His halls were called
Gladsheim Valaskjalf and Valhalla.  Odin's high seat, Hlidskialf, was in
Valaskjalf.  It was from this throne that he could see over all the world. 
Valhalla is where he gathered his portion of the slain warriors, Einheriar,
whom the valkyries had chosen.  The valkyries would serve mead which forever
flowed from the udder of Odin's goat, Heidrun.  They also served the
warriors meat that came from the boar Saehrimnir, which the cook Andhrimnir
would prepare for eating by boiling it in the cauldron Eldhrimnir.  The boar
magically came back to life before the next meal.  After eating, the
warriors would go outside the hall and fight each other to the death.  They
were, of course, brought back to life before the next feast.  All of this
fighting was practice for when Odin would lead the Einheriar in the final
battle, Ragnarok.  Odin had a spear named Grungir which never missed its
mark and a bow which unleashed ten arrows with every pull.  He also owned a
magic ring called Draupnir which created nine of itself every night.  It was
this ring that Odin laid on his son Balder's funeral pyre and which Balder
returned to Odin from the underworld.  Another one of Odin's prized
possesions was his wonderful steed named Sleipnir which had eight legs.  The
horse was the offspring of Loki, who in mare form seduced a giant's horse
named Svadilfari.  Sleipnir could travel to the underworld and through the
air.  Odin also had two wolves, Geri and Freki, and two ravens, Hugin
[thought] and Munin [memory].  He sent his ravens out every day to gather
knowledge for him.  Odin sacrificed himself for knowledge by hanging on the
world tree, Yggdrasil, which means Ygg's horse.  Ygg is a name for Odin and
horse is a metaphor for the gallows.  He thereby learns the runes.  Another
sacrifice he made for wisdom was his eye.  He gave it up in order to drink
from the Well of Mimir which bestowed great knowledge.  Because of this, he
is typically depicted as having one eye.  He is also depicted as wearing a
cloak, being old, having a long grey beard, and wearing a wide brimmed hat
down low over his face to conceal his one-eyed visage.  Odin was destined to
die at Ragnarok; Fenris-Wolf swallowed him.  Knowing his fate, he still
chose to embrace it and do battle.  Showing the true warrior ethic.  He was
the god of warriors and kings, not the common man.  Many heroes genealogies
start with Odin, including Sigurd.  His name is not found in many place
names and therefore it is believed that not many people worshipped him.  He
was thought to be a traitorous god, as shown in the sagas, who would strike
down a warrior at his whim.  
~

-1 SIF~
Goddess of crops and fertility, married to Thor.  At one point, Loki
stole her hair and had to replace it.  He went to the dwarves and had them
make her a new set of hair out of gold.  An interesting thing to note is
that short hair was a sign of a whore or a slave.  
~

-1 SNOTRA~
Wise and gentle goddess.  Guerber calls her the goddess of virtue and
master of all knowledge.  She knew the value of self-discipline.  
~

-1 THOR~
The son of Odin and a member of the Aesir, he was the god of thunder and
the main enemy of the giants.  He would smash their heads with his mighty
hammer Mjollnir.  To wield this awesome weapon he needed iron gloves and a
belt of strength.  Mjollnir would return to Thor's hand after being thrown
and was symbolic of lightning.  Thor would ride around middle-earth in his
wagon drawn by two goats, His abode was Thruthheim [Land of Strength] and
his hall, Bilskinir.  His wife was Sif.  He was foremost of the gods to the
common man, who would call on him to ensure fertility, and widely worshiped.
Hammer shaped amulets, a symbol of Thor because it was his weapon, were worn
about the neck well into the christianization of Scandinavia.  There are
molds from that time which contain both cross and hammer shapes, side by
side.  His name occurs in numerous place names, and it was his statue which
was central in the great temple at Uppsala.  Thursday is named for him and
he was associated by the Romans with Jupiter.  Donar was an early version of
Thor among the early Germans.  The anglo-saxons worshiped a thunder god
named Thunor.  
~

-1 TYR~
God of war.  He was the only god brave enough to put his hand in the
Fenris- wolf's mouth so the gods could bind it.  The wolf bit off his right
hand.  There is much debate about his lefthandedness.  In the norse culture
the right hand was given for a pledge, which could be why the right hand was
placed in the wolf's mouth.  It has also been noted, however, that the
offering of the right hand is to show that it is free of weapons.  A left
handed person was sometimes considered evil because he could use a weapon
with his left hand even though he shook with his right hand.  Tuesday is
named for Tyr who was known as Tiw, or Tiu, by the Anglo-Saxons.  
~

-1 ULL~
God of archery and the hunt, according to some he was a god of skiers and
the snowshoe.  His weapon was a longbow made out of Yew and he lived in Ydal
[Yew Dales].  He was called upon for help in duels.  He was the son (or
step-son) of Thor and Sif (or Ovandrill, depending on the source).  His
name, which means glorious, is a part of many place names, therefore, he is
considered to be an ancient god who was widely worshipped.  It is believed
that at one time he was one of the highest gods.

The ROT skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making 
him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick 
at character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are  
paid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the 
harder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to 
practice. 
 
The experience breakdown is as follows:  
points   exp/level     points   exp/level 
40        1000         90        6000

The weapon skills consist of the following: 
 
axe             the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds) 
dagger          the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons 
flail           skill in ball-and-chain type weapons 
mace            this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces 
polearm         the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds 
spear           this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms 
sword           the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore 
whip            the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips 
exotic          the use of strange magical weapons 
 
The exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level. 
~

-1 TRANSPORT~
Syntax: cast transport <object> <char> 
 
This spell will transport an obj from your inventory to the inventory of 
another player.  You can turn off the ability to recieve transports using 
the notran command. 
~

-1 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield. 
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves 
well with a shield.  All classes may learn shield block, but only warriors and 
clerics are good at it.  Beware, flails ignore shield blocking attempts, and 
whips have an easier time getting around them.  Axes may split shields in two. 
~

-1 SHIELDING FIRESHIELD ICESHIELD SHOCKSHIELD~
These arcane and costly spells are only for the most learned of the ranks of 
mages and clerics wandering the land.  They require great amounts of energy 
and can be very devastating.
 
        iceshield       surrounds target with a thick shell of ice 
        fireshield      surrounds target with a flaming inferno 
        shockshield     surrounds target with a crackling sphere 
 
These spells were coded by Kelson (Micah Bartell) for use with ROM based muds, 
and are released under the GNU license.(use them, edit them, give me mention) 
Questions and comments can be sent to micah@cse.unl.edu. 
~

-1 BACKSTAB~
Backstab is the favored attack of thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It  
can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons. 
The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his 
weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent. 
Only thieves may learn the backstab. 
~

-1 BASH~
The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock 
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the 
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon 
is not generally a wise idea. 
~

-1 BERSERK~
Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage 
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge 
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.   
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic. 
~

-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~
Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever  
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The 
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity 
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.
~

-1 DISARM~
Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your 
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you 
are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon.  The size of a weapon is
a factor.  It's not a good idea to try to disarm a battle axe with a dagger.
~

-1 DODGE~
In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not 
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the 
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the  
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the 
attacker and the target.
~

-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
Enhanced Damage behaves differently for every 3rd tier class.
The 1st and 2nd tiers just get a flat rate.  Class-specific 3rd tier enhanced acts as follows:
 
{Y/*************************************{RENHANCED DAMAGE{Y*************************************\

~

-1 ENVENOM~
The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to 
win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength. 
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish. 
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned 
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to 
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could 
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on 
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison  
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates  
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat. 
~

-1 'HAND TO HAND'~
Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this 
style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands. 
Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.
Monks are true masters at this skill.
~

-1 KICK~
Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful 
kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters 
and clerics are the most skilled at kicking.
~

-1 PARRY~
If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting  
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for 
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced 
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the 
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type. 
~

-1 RESCUE~
A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with 
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede 
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the 
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as 
well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and 
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster) 
~

-1 TRIP~
Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves 
using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground. 
Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will 
find the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip. 
~

-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~
Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes 
in combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every 
round.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a  
very hard time with it. 
~

-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~
Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike 
in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect 
third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors, rangers, 
and highly skilled thieves may learn this skill. 
~

-1 'FOURTH ATTACK'~
Training in fourth attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike 
in a combat, and increases the chance of a third attack as well.  Perfect 
fourth attack does NOT assure four attacks per round.  Only warriors, rangers, 
and highly skilled thieves may learn this skill. 
~

-1 'FIFTH ATTACK'~
Training in fifth attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike 
in a combat, and increases the chance of a fourth attack as well.  Perfect 
fifth attack does NOT assure five attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly 
skilled rangers may learn this skill. 
~

-1 'SIXTH ATTACK'~
Training in sixth attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike 
in a combat, and increases the chance of a fifth attack as well.  Perfect 
sixth attack does NOT assure six attacks per round.  Only swashbucklers 
may learn this skill. 
~

-1 HIDE~
Hide is a skill used to render a person invisible to the casual observer.
It is impossible to know if you are hidden, and any action at all will
leave you exposed.  Only characters with acute vision has a chance to see
a hidden person.
~

-1 SNEAK~
Sneak allows the user to enter and leave rooms undetected.  A skill favored by
thieves, it helps in suprising a victim.
~

-1 'FAST HEALING'~
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting, 
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general  
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is  
possible for it to fail.
~

-1 LORE~
Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use 
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object, 
concerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value 
of an object, because more will be known about its worth.
~

-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~
Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to 
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise, 
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.
~

-1 PEEK~
Syntax: peek <char> 
This will attempt to peek at a characters inventory, you may also make 
this automatic during a 'look <char>' by turning on AUTOPEEK. 
~

-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain 
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by   
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may 
learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy. 
~

-1 MEDITATE~
This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and 
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
~

-1 STEAL~
Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class. 
It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters.
~

-1 'DETECT GOOD'~
Syntax: cast 'detect good' 
  
This spell enables the caster to detect good characters, which will 
reveal a characteristic golden aura. 
~

-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~
Syntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim> 
  
This spell invokes the wrath of evil on a good victim, causing massive
damage. 
~

-1 'RECHARGE'~
Syntax: cast 'recharge' <item> 
 
The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves. 
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell 
is proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be 
recharged one time successfully. 
~

-1 'DEMONFIRE'~
Syntax: cast 'demonfire' <target> 
 
Demonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those 
who follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to  
inflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster. 
~

-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~
Syntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target> 
 
Ray of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth 
a beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants 
of evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike  
casters who are tainted by evil. 
~

-1 'PORTAL'~
Syntax: cast 'portal' <target> 
 
The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal 
to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are 
entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'enter portal'.  Portals cannot 
be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms. 
Portal requires the special power of a warp stone.
~

-1 'NEXUS'~
Syntax: cast 'nexus' <target> 
 
This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the 
only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus  
spell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered 
portal spell.  Nexus requires the special power of a warp stone.
~

-1 'HEAT METAL'~
Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <target> 
 
Heat metal is a powerful attack spell, with effects that vary according
to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment on the target, 
causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the 
process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily). 
This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire. 
~

-1 'HOLY WORD'~
Syntax: cast 'holy word' 
 
Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with 
disasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful 
blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the 
room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of 
opposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests) 
are struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers 
greatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and  
drained of vitality. 
~

-1 FRENZY~
Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target> 
 
The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing 
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine 
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety,  
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm 
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's  
alignment. 
~

-1 CALM~
Syntax: cast 'calm'  
 
One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is 
the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed 
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage 
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence  
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing -- 
either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who 
are immune to magic) or none is. 
~

-1 HASTE~
Syntax: cast 'haste' <target> 
 
The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing 
an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive 
abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system, 
such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating 
the slow spell. (see 'help slow'). 
~

-1 SLOW~
Syntax: cast 'slow' <target> 
 
Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell 
with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim, 
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate 
of attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing 
rates, due to reduced metabolism. 
~

-1 PLAGUE~
Syntax: cast 'plague' <target> 
 
The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence, 
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to 
death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like 
wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area. 
~

-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL'~
Syntax: cast 'protection evil' <target> 
        cast 'protection good' <target> 
 
The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate 
ethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not 
be cast on others, and one person cannot carry both defenses at the same 
time. 
~

0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~
Syntax: cast 'giant strength' <character> 
  
This spell increases the strength of the target character. 
~

-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~
Syntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target> 
 
Chain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning 
that arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully 
expended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members  
of a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other 
viable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on 
groups of creatures. 
~

-1 SCAN FARSIGHT~
scan farsight 
Syntax: scan 
        scan <direction> 
        cast 'farsight' 
 
The scan command allows the user to detect movement in surrounding areas. 
 
The farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her 
to see far away beings like they were in the same room. The spell may be
used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in all directions,
or with a directional component to see creatures much farther away. 
~

-1 MASS HEALING~
Syntax: cast 'mass healing'  
 
The mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell 
on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good 
measure. 
~

-1 FIREPROOF~
Syntax: cast 'fireproof' <object> 
 
The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object, 
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected 
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell. 
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical 
for protecting large numbers of objects. 
~

-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~
Syntax: alias 
        alias <word> 
        alias <word> <substitution> 
        unalias <word> 
 
The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time, 
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command. 
Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with  
that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument  
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new 
command.  Examples of use: 
 
alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse' 
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc' 
 
Only the first word on the line will be subsituted as an alias.

-1 PLATINUM GOLD SILVER MONEY~
Midgard's economy is based on platinum, gold and silver coinage (and the 
lowly copper, which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry). 
Platinum coins are worth 100 gold coins.  Gold coins are worth 100 silver 
coins.  Gems can be bought to alleviate weight problems from the 
Midgard jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more than they are worth. 
~

0 BRIEF COMPACT~
Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief 
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around 
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact  
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.

There are a few special secret damage messages for certain damages, see if you can get em all!
~

-1 DEAF~
The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being bombarded 
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to 
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you 
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a diety (it's mostly  
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to 
a person). 
~

-1 AFK~
Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell 
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing 
replay.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes, 
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is 
turned off. 
 
Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be 
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before 
reading them). 
~

-1 PROMPT~
Syntax: prompt 
Syntax: prompt all 
Syntax: prompt <%*> 
  
PROMPT with out an argument will turn your prompt on or off. 
  
PROMPT ALL will give you the standard "<hits mana moves>" prompt. 
  
PROMPT <%*> where the %* are the various variables you may set yourself. 
  
        %h :  Display your current hits 
        %H :  Display your maximum hits 
        %g :  Display your current hits (G/Y/R)
        %m :  Display your current mana 
        %M :  Display your maximum mana 
        %n :  Display your current mana (G/Y/R)
        %v :  Display your current moves 
        %V :  Display your maximum moves 
        %w :  Display your current moves (G/Y/R)
        %x :  Display your current experience 
{x        %A :  Display experience to next focus level
        %X :  Display experience to level 
        %P :  Display your platinum held 
        %G :  Display your gold held 
        %S :  Display your silver held 
        %$ :  Display your money held (all kinds)
        %a :  Display your alignment 
        %Q :  Display your quest timer
        %r :  Display the room name you are in 
        %e :  Display the exits from the room in NESWDU style 
        %c :  Display a carriage return (useful for multi-line prompts) 
        %R :  Display the vnum you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY) 
        %z :  Display the area name you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY) 
        %1 :  Display your HP in a graphical bar (ie. [**********])
        %2 :  Display your mana in a graphical bar.
        %3 :  Display your moves in a graphical bar.
{0        %d :  Display your visibility.  U means undetected, D means detected,
              and ? means you don't know. You don't know 75% of the time.
{{x      %T :  Display the terrain when detect terrain is on.
{x        %t :  Display the current time in am or pm
  
Example:  PROMPT <%hhp %mm %vmv> 
        Will set your prompt to "<100hp 100m 100mv>"
~

-1 ALIGN ALIGNMENT~
Alignment is an expression of your attitudes on life and how you react 
to situations. There's good, neutral, and evil alignment. Your alignment 
is affected by the alignment of the foes you kill; kill an evil monster 
and your alignment shifts towards good, kill a good one, and you head 
towards the dark side of things. 
 
Alignment is expressed in numbers from 1000 (pure good) to -1000 (pure evil), 
with 0 being true neutral. Most creatures are neither wholly evil nor wholly 
good and have alignment scores between 500 and -500. You can check your 
alignment by typing SCORE. Spells such as DETECT GOOD, DETECT EVIL, and KNOW 
ALIGNMENT will show you the alignment of others. 
 
Alignment affects what equipment you may wear, weapons you may use, how 
creatures react to you, experience gained, and, in some cases, what exits 
you see.  The Temple of Thoth houses recall for good and high-neutral aligned 
characters.  The Temple of Belan is home to those of evil and low-neutral 
alignment.  Equipment that is not suited to your alignment will be "zapped" 
off of you when you try to wear it. If you are of good alignment, on occasion, 
Thoth will protect you from harm in battle (usually from teleport spells), 
but Belan, being evil, leaves his followers to fend for themselves. 
 
Should you wish to change your alignment in some way other than fighting 
oppositely-aligned foes, you will pay dearly.  Go to the church in Midgard 
near Clan Road and either REPENT ALIGN or CURSE ALIGN at the appropriate 
priest for the alignment you wish to become. 
~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at either the morgue or
your clan hall's recall.  If you are above level 20, your corpse is left 
behind where you were killed.
 
Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death. 
 
Following and groups are not affected by death. 
 
You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is two-thirds of  
the way back to the beginning of your level. 
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set  
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points. 
 
You gain experience by: 
 
    being part of a group that kills a monster 
 
You lose experience by: 
 
    fleeing from combat 
    recalling out of combat 
    being the target of certain spells 
    dying 
 
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: Your level
versus the level of the monster; your alignment versus the monster's
alignment; how many of this monster have been killed lately; and some
random variation. 
~

0 COLOUR COLOR ANSI~
Syntax: colour              Toggles colour mode on/off 
        colour list         Lists the available colours and channels 
        colour #            Sets your default colour to # 
        colour <channel> #  Sets the channel colour to # 
 
Use the list option to view a list of all the channels you can set a color 
for, along with the color numbers to use for channels and the default color. 
 
Using a number as the only argument will set your default color to this 
number. (Default color is the color most text is displayed in) 
 
Using a channel name as the first argument and a number as the second argument 
will set this channels color to the number. for example: 
       colour ic 13 
This will change the IC channel color from the default bright blue to 
bright magenta. 
 
You may also talk in colour; the format is like this: the 'escape character' 
to specify a colour is the left handed brace '{{', following that you should 
use one of the following numbers, 
 
         {x{{0     reset, returns to default 
 
         {r{{1     red     {m{{5     magenta 
         {g{{2     green   {c{{6     cyan 
         {y{{3     yellow  {w{{7     white 
         {b{{4     blue    {D{{8     grey{x 
 
For brighter colours, use the shifted numbers: {R!{G@{Y#{B${M%{C^{W&{x

       Both 0 and 17 will turn off any default color, reverting back 
       to your terminals default color. 
    If setting a channel color: 
       0 will reset the color back to the games default. 
       17 will set the color to your default text color, or to your

You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after  
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement. 
{RNaming a pet after yourself or another player is ILLEGAL{x
~

0 FLAG FLAGS~
The following are the description flags for players and mobiles: 
      {x[{yV{DH{cC{bT{wP{CI{rF{BL{RE{YG{WS{GQ{x] 
Where: 
       {yV{x = Invisible 
        {DH{x = Hiding 
         {cC{x = Charmed 
          {bT{x = Translucent (pass_door) 
           {wP{x = Faerie Fire 
            {CI{x = Ice Shield 
             {rF{x = Fire Shield 
              {BL{x = Shock Shield 
               {RE{x = Evil 
                {YG{x = Good 
                 {WS{x = Sanctuary 
                  {GQ{x = Quest 
 
The following are the description flags for equiptment: 
      {x[{yV{RE{BB{MM{YG{WH{GQ{x] 
Where: 
       {yV{x = Invisible 
        {RE{x = Evil 
         {BB{x = Blessed 
          {MM{x = Magical 
           {YG{x = Glowing 
            {WH{x = Humming 
             {GQ{x = Quest 
 
You may switch to the old format for flags (as used on other 
muds) at any time with the 'long' command. 
~

0 LONG~
The LONG command will affect the way you see special flags on other 
characters and equipment.  With the long flag set, you will see the 
flags much as you do on other muds, most of them as (Aura)'s. 
Without the long flag (default), you will see any flags within 
a much shorter table.  See 'HELP FLAGS' for the shorter tables. 
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat, 
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration, 
weather, and area resetting. 
 
Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the 
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual 
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds. 
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less 
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground 
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets. 
~

0 !~
Syntax: ! 
 
! repeats the last command you typed. 
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north 
Syntax: south 
Syntax: east 
Syntax: west 
Syntax: up 
Syntax: down 
 
Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.  It is easiest to
shorten the command by typing just n, s, e, w, u, or d.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target> 
 
Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice, 
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana. 
The mana cost decreases as your level increases. 
 
The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an 
appropriate default target, especially during combat. 
 
If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name. 
Example: cast 'cure critical' Kaz.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells. 
You can abbreviate the spell name. 
 
When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw. 
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the 
saving throw successfully. 
 
See also the help sections for individual spells. 
~

0 exits~
Syntax: exits 
 
Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible. 
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a 
certain direction and see what you bump into). 
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object> 
Syntax: drop <amount> <coin tupe> 
Syntax: drop all.<object>
Syntax: get  <object> 
Syntax: get  <object> <container> 
Syntax: get all.<object>
Syntax: give <object> <character> 
Syntax: give <amount> <coin tupe> <character> 
Syntax: put  <object> <container> 
 
DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground. 
 
GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even 
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get. 
 
GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character. 
PUT puts an object into a container. 
 
Using 'all.' as a suffix to drop or get allows a character to get or drop all of
the items matching the description.  In example, typing 'get all.sword' will get
every sword lying on the ground, and typing 'get all.pie pack' will get all of
the pies from the pack
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment 
Syntax: inventory 
 
EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items). 
INVENTORY lists your inventory. 
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2> 
Syntax: compare <object> 
  
COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons, 
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are 
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class. 
  
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object 
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type. 
  
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects. 
~

0 FINGER~
Syntax: finger <name> 
The finger command will tell you the last time a player logged off 
the system.  The entered name must match the players name completely, 
and cannot be abbreviated. 
~

0 FLEE~
Syntax: flee 
Syntax: rescue   <character> 
 
Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight 
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can 
RESCUE you.
 
If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep 
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances 
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience. 
~

-1 DONATE CDONATE~
Syntax: donate  <object> 
        cdonate <object> 
 
The donate command will transfer an object from your inventory to the 
donation pit.  If you are a clan member, the cdonate command will donate 
the object to your clans donation pit, otherwise, it will work the same 
as a normal donate.  Some objects may not be donated, such as quest items, 
cursed items, and sub-issue gear. 
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK READ~
Syntax: look 
Syntax: look    <object> 
Syntax: look    <character> 
Syntax: look    <direction> 
Syntax: look    <keyword> 
Syntax: examine <container> 
Syntax: examine <corpse> 
 
LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see. 
 
EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'. 
 
READ Is the same as LOOK 
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command 
Syntax: order all command 
 
ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to 
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible 
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers 
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly. 
 
Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed). 
 
If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm. 
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest 
Syntax: sleep 
Syntax: stand 
Syntax: wake 
 
These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you  
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster. 
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP, 
you won't hear many things happen. 
 
Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can 
also WAKE other sleeping characters. 
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message> 
Syntax: say   <message> 
Syntax: tell  <character> <message> 
 
All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to 
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are 
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL. 
 
SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote ''' 
is a synonym for SAY. 
 
TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world. 
 
REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work 
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This

-1 NOTE NOTES CHANGES NEWS PENALTY IDEA WEDDINGS UNREAD~
The notes on ROT replace the bulletin boards and mail systems found on many 
other mud.  The following options are usable: 
 
reading notes: 
note list       : show all notes (unread notes are marked with an N) 
note read       : either by number, or read next to read unread notes 
note remove     : removes a note that you wrote or are the target of 
note catchup    : markes all notes as read 
 
writing new notes: 
note to         : sets the to line (playername, clanname, immortal, or all) 
note subject    : sets the subject for a new note 
note +          : adds a line to a new note (i.e. note + hi guys!) 
note -          : remove a line from a note in progress 
note clear      : erase a note in progress 
note show       : shows the note you are working on 
note post       : posts a new note. This MUST be done to post a note. 
note edit       : enters append mode.
 
When you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. Type 
note read to scroll through them one at a time. 
 
Five other note directories exist, these are ideas, news, changes, weddings, 
and penalties (gods only).  They are used the exact same way, for example 
idea read 5 will read idea #5.  Posting to the news, changes, and weddings 
boards is restricted.  The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread
notes on all the note spools.

Group members may use the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  Grouping with others
does not reduce the amount of xp you recieve form a kill.

minutes.  It's good to save when you raise a level, or gain an important
item, for they may be lost if a crash occurs.  Save lag has been removed for
your convenience.

Quit leaves the game, and removes your character from play.  It automatically
saves and disconnectes you.  You may not quit if you have a PK flag on, or

session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will 
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you 
do use them. 
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana> 
 
TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your 
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several 
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by 
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town). 
 
It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase 
mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level. 
 
The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more 
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points. 
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train 
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else. 
 
If you want to put ALL of your trains into hp/mana/move then the syntax is:
train <hp/mana/move> all
Beware this is irreversable and will immediately spend all your trains!

may also be used to demote characters. 
~

110 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level> 
 
TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to 
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect 
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or 
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up 
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their 
natural level. 
 
A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again. 
~

110 WEDPOST~

106 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
Syntax: allow   <site> 
        ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit> 
        ban

no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from 
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner. 
 
A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set 
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site. 
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or  
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many 
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used. 
~

109 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot 
        shutdown 
 
Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used 
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow 
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

from restarting it. 
~

108 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock 
        newlock 
 
Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROT. Wizlock locks 
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 101), except for link-dead players who 
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically 
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided, 
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps. 
 
A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game. 
~

106 DENY WIPE~
Syntax: deny <name> 
        wipe <name> 
 
DENY and WIPE lock a character out of a game permanently, rendering their 
character name unusable.  They may only be removed by editing the pfile, for 
this reason freeze is usually preferred. 
 
If a player is DENY'd, they will be sent a message telling them so, then 
will be forced to quit.  They will then recieve a message telling them 
they are denyed access any time they try to connect. 
 
If a player is WIPE'd, they will recieve no message, and will be immediatly 
vdisconnected.  They will immediatly be disconnected any time they attempt 
to connect, with no explanation. 
~

107 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect <name> 
 
Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet 
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying 
players. 
~

106 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name> 
 
FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any 
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a  
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command. 
~

109 DUPE~
Syntax: dupe <character> <name> 
 
DUPE will add or remove a dupe account name to a list kept on the players 
account.  Anytime this player connects, all characters on their dupe list 
will be forced to quit (except immortals).  This should be used only on 
those who flagrantly violate the rule against bringing in more than one 
character at a time and using one character to build a second.  Entering 
a dupe that is already on the list will cause it to be removed. 
 
Using DUPE <character> without the second argument will list that 
characters current dupes. 
~

0 IQUEST~
Syntax: Iquest          Turns your quest flag on. 
 
The quest flag identifies players participating in a quest.  It also 
protects the player during a quest, by making them non-pkill. 
 
The quest flag can only be set when the global quest flag is on, and 
can not be turned off until you either quit and relog, or the quest has 
been completed.  Upon the completion of the quest, the flag will be 
turned off automatically when the global quest flag is removed. 
 
When the global quest flag is on, a message will be displayed at the 
bottom of the 'who' list.

Syntax: Iquest Restore     Restores everyone.
Syntax: Load Obj 9817      Loads a quest pill.
Syntax: Load obj 35293     Loads a shimmering medallion.
 
Imm quests are a good thing, but not in excess.  Try to run 2 or 3 daily,
but not one right after another.  A good number of participants is 5 or
more people.  Depending on the quest, you can give one pill for every
point, or 3 pills for first, 2 for second, and 1 for third place.

After every quest, write a note to Aesir what prizes you loaded, and who
got them.
 
Possible quests:
{#Questguy quest{x:   Log on the character: questguy, password:
iquest21{x, then goto the center of the newbie arena (3734.)  Trans
everyone there and restore them.  Make sure everyone is ready, then
{1twit{x questguy and run around with him.  Be sure not to leave the
arena.  Also be sure that wiznet: deaths is on.  The person who kills
quest guy gets a point.  This quest is good if there are a lot of
legends on.  Be sure to state that no rescuing or room atatck spells
are allowed.
 
{#Trivia{x:   Give questions over qgoss and the first person to answer
correctly gets a point.  An optional rule is to have it so the person
who gets the question right gets to choose the next subject.
 
{#Decipher the drunk{x:  Set your drunk to 40, then say something over
qgossip.  The first person to guess what you said gets a quest point.
Some people can find this easy, so end the quest if a person is dominating.
Also, if nobody knows it, then bring your drunk down some.
 
{#Treasure hunt{x:   A treasure hunt is best held at the elemental valley
(9206) since it has a big group of low level mobiles.  Load up 1.5 pills per
person, and one shimmering medal per person.  Cubics are also nice prizes,
only load one per person.  Distribute these items to random mobiles in the
area.  When you are done, trans everyone to 9206, and state the rules.
Tell the questers that they can not use magic, wands, peek, or any other
room attacking skills.  When they are ready, tell them to go.  Keep tabs on
the items you loaded, and tell the mortals to stop when they have gathered 
them all.  Whomever has the most shimmering medallions at the end, earns
an extra 2 quest points.  Second place earns 1.
 
{#Hot Potato{x:   Load object 27502, the hot potato.  Trans everyone to 
the center of the newbie arena.  Tell everyone to remove any perma-sneak
items, and go vis.  Give them the start signal, and trans the potato to a
random person.  A person with a hot potato must try to give it to somone
else as fast as they can.  Yell "{{zPotato!{x" over qgossip after about a
minute.  Whomever has the potato is out, and must recall.  Repeat the
process until there are 3 people left.  At this time, distribute the prizes.
 
{#Kill the Immortal{x:   This only works with 5 or less other people, and is
for 101's only.  Once the 5 has been gathered up, remove your immortal
weapons, and wear something more conventional.  Issue an arena challenge
with the 5 and have everyone accept.  The mortals then try to kill you.
If they do, they gain a quest point.  If they loose, then they loose a
quest point.  Every time you die, make it harder (Cast haste, wear better
weapons, etc.).  If they loose, make it slightly easier.  Distribute pills
when the quest is over.  And don't take away qp if the total is negative.
 
{#Misc{x:   If you think of something else, feel free to use it.
Note quests are also nice.  Such as an item gathering one.  If a quest
turns out to be too easy, it's not good to continue.
 
{#Red Light Green Light:  {0Trans everybody to 32300.  Make sure everybody
understands the rules, which are easy, then goto 32350.  Try to be good
and watch when they move.  This isn't a hard quest for an imm to give
but mortals will try and trick you, IE at room 9 and going to room 19
so it looks like they didn't move.  Anyway, just qgossip Green Light for
them to move and qgossip Red Light for them to stop.  Follow red light
with an immediate where to see where everybody is, if they move, trans
them back to 32300.  First one to the end wins.  Don't let them use run.

        sockets <name>  
 
SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including  
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the  
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in  
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in. 
 
The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used 
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched 
into an orc). 
~

104 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum> 
        load obj <vnum> <level> 
 
The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to  
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum 
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object. 
 
Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are 
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old 
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new 
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set. 
(see also clone, vnum, stat) 
~

104 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string> 
        string mob <field> <string> 
 
The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or

        noshout   <character> 
        notell    <character> 
        notitle   <character> 
 
NOEMOTE, NOSHOUT, and NOTELL are used to muffle other characters, by 
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively. 
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those 
forms of communication. 
 
The NOCHANNEL command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim 
from using any of the channels (IC, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game. 
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels. 
 
The NORESTORE command makes a player immune to the restore command. 
This is used to punish players who constantly ask for restores from 
immortals. 
 
The NOCLAN command makes a player unable to join pkill-type clans. 
This is used to punish players who are known to cause serious troubles 
with pkilling. 
 
The NOTITLE command makes a player unable to set their own title. 
This is used to punish players who use the title for swearing, 
threats, etc.... 
~

103 TWIT PARDON~
Syntax: twit   <character> 
        pardon <character> 
 
TWIT sets the Twit flag on a player.  When set, the twit flag causes 
any mobiles in a LAW room (all of Midgard) to attack the player, 
and the shopkeepers will not sell to the player.  Also, any player may 
attack and kill a player with the twit flag, whether they can normally 
pkill or not. 
 
PARDON will remove the Twit flag if set. 
~

102 PURGE~
Syntax: purge 
        purge <character>

NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one 
character from anywhere in the world. 
 
Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag 
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be 
purged if they are called directly by name. 
~

106 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character> 
        restore room 
        restore all 
 
Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the 
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness. 
 
Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player 
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all 
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly 
or not at all. 
~

107 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character> 
 
Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this 
command on players if you enjoy being a god. 
~

104 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
Syntax: transfer <character> 
        transfer all 
        transfer <character> <location> 
        transfer all         <location> 
 
Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters, 
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all  
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have 
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer.  
~

102 RECOVER~
Syntax: recover <character> 
 
Recover transfers the target character to their default recall point. 
You may only recover a character who is either cursed, or is stuck in 
a no-recall area. 
~

104 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command> 
 
At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given 
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of 
a mobile, or as the name of an object. 
 
At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the 
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your 
location). 
~

102 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message> 
        gecho <message> 
        pecho <character> <message> 
 
These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to 
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent 
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho 
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level 
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it 
is an echo. 
~

102 GOTO~
Syntax: goto 
        goto <location> 
 
Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, 
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object. 
 
Goto with no argument will take you to your default location if you 
have one set. (see GSET)  If used in this manner, your pet will be 
transfered with you. 
 
You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters 
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters 
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain 
god level. 
 
Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms. 
~

102 GSET~
Syntax: gset <vnum> 
 
Gset allows you to set the default location for the goto command to 
take you to. 
~

102 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight 
        wiznvis <level> 
 
Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and 
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more 
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see. 
 
Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will make you invisible to all players of 
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum 
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 110 characters are totally  
invisible. 
~

102 INCOGNITO GHOST~
Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the 
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you. 
Toggling your ghost status will do the exact opposite, making you invisible 
to anyone in the same room as you, but visible to those outside the room. 
While ghost is set, you will still appear visible to all characters in the 
game through the 'who' command. (depending on your wizinv level) 
Both take a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level 
or higher can see you regarless of location. 
These flags are mutually exclusive, turning on one will automatically turn 
the other off. 
~

102 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory 
 
Memory reports the size of your mud. 
 
The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects, 
not the number of instances currently in the game. 
 
The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have 
a maximum limit, which is also shown. 
 
The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit 
on the number and size of these blocks. 
~

Syntax: vnum <name> 
        vnum <obj or mob> <name> 
        vnum skill <name> 
        vnum area 
 
Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out 
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is 
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and 
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name. Vnum area lists 
all areas and their range of vnums. 
(see also load) 
~

102 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name> 
        stat mob  <name> 
        stat obj  <name> 
        stat room <number> 
 
The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room 
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object 
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room  
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are 
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto. 
(see also goto, transfer) 
~

Syntax: mwhere <name> 
 
Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name. 
~

~

102 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin  <message> 
Syntax: pooffout <message> 
 
The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and 
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of 
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages 
must include your name somewhere in the string. 
 
Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you. 
(see also goto) 
~

109 PROTECT~
Syntax: protect <character> 
 
Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing  
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character. 
~

105 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character> 
        log   all 
        snoop <character> 
 
Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into 
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle. 
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied 
by mail to the implementors. 
 
Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain 
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged. 
 
Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not 
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps. 
 
Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character. 
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one 
character at a time. Try to respect privacy. 
 
Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops. 
~

103 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character> 
        return

switch into link-dead PCs. 
 
Return returns you to your original body. 
~

102 IMMTALK :~
Syntax: immtalk <message> 
        immtalk 
 
Immtalk sends a message to all immortals.  : is a synonym for immtalk.

turns it back on). 
~

-1 WIZNET~
Syntax: wiznet  
        wiznet show 
        wiznet status 
        wiznet <field> 
 
Wiznet is sort of an immortal news service, to show important events to 
the wiznetted immortal.  Wiznet by itself turns wiznet on and off,  
wiznet show lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here),  
wiznet status shows your current wiznet settings, and wiznet <field> toggles 
a field on and off.  The events should be self-explanatory, if they are not, 
fiddle with them a while.  More events are available at higher levels. 
~

-1 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp 
 
Wizhelp provides a list of all the immortal commands. 
~

This monk only skill is similar to it's brother skills of second, third,
fourth and fifth attack.  The difference is, it's level base, and
potentially has some rather aweing effects.  Want to find out more?  Fight
a monk.  
~

0 ASSASSINATE~

gives the thief a small chance to do a one-hit kill.  Assassins are the
only people who wields this skill.
~

This spell cures blindness in one so unfortunate. 
~

0 'CURE POISON'~
Syntax: cast 'cure poison' <character>

~

0 'CURE LIGHT' 'CURE SERIOUS' 'CURE CRITICAL' HEAL~
Syntax: cast 'cure light'    <character> 
Syntax: cast 'cure serious'  <character> 
Syntax: cast 'cure critical' <character> 
Syntax: cast 'heal'          <character> 
 
These spells cure damage on the target character.  The higher-level spells 
heal more damage. 
 
(see 'help healer' for details on the heal command) 
~

0 CURSE REPENT~
Syntax: cast 'curse' <character> 
Syntax: curse  <spell> 
Syntax: repent <spell> 
 
This spell reduces the character's to-hit roll and save versus spells. 
It also renders the character unclean in the eyes of the gods and 
unable to RECALL. Curse may be used to fill equipment with evil power, 
allowing (for example) weapons to do more damage to particularly holy 
opponents. 
 
The CURSE and REPENT commands work like the HEAL command. 
You need to find the right priest in order to use these commands. 
~

0 'DETECT EVIL'~

reveal a characteristic red aura.

~

0 'DISPEL MAGIC' CANCELLATION~
Syntax: cast 'dispel magic' <character> 
        cast 'cancellation' <characte> 
  
Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target.  Dispel magic 
has a reduced chance of working, and is considering an attack spell. 
Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does 
not provoke attack.  Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between 
harmful and benign spells. 
  
The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells 
(such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all spells may 
be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague. 
~

0 EARTHQUAKE~

~

0 'ENCHANT WEAPON'~
Syntax: cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon> 
 
This spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing its to-hit and to-dam 
bonuses by one or two points.  Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the

destroyed by the magic.  Also, every successful enchant increases the level 
of the weapon by one...and there is no turning back. 
~

-1 'ENCHANT ARMOR'~
The enchant armor spell imbues armor with powerful protective magics. It is 
not nearly as reliable as enchant weapon, being far more prone to destructive 
effects.  Each succesful enchant increases the plus of the armor by 1 or 2 
points, and raises its level by one. 
~

including the caster.

This spell will conjure up a powerful pet demon.  As pets, a demon cannot 
be conjured if you already have a pet.  The conjure spell requires a 
special source of power to be used, a rare demon stone.
~

0 VOODOO~
Syntax: cast voodoo 
        voodoo <pin|trip|throw> 
 
The voodoo spell will turn a sliced-off body part of a PC character into 
a voodoo doll.  Hold the body part in your hand when casting. 
 
The voodoo command can be used to inflict pain, trip, or throw another 
player accross the room (or sometimes out of the room).  Hold the 
voodoo doll in your hand when using the command. 
 
Voodoo dolls in your name can be destroyed with the help of the priests 
in the church, but at a hefty price. 
 
After the successful use of a voodoo doll, your victim will be immune to 
the effects of another use for 1 tick. 
 
{RWARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING{x 
Having a voodoo doll in your inventory makes you vulnerable to 
{RPKILL{x by the victim of the curse, with {RNO{x restrictions 
of level, tier, or clan affiliation.

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you  
can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very  
confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and  
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows: 
 
{@VIPER:{x  A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating  
        on striking your opponent before they have the chance to  
        avoid or block you. 
{@CRANE:{x  A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a  
        very strong blocking defence. 
{@CRAB:{x   A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork  
        and rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries. 
{@MONGOOSE:{x  A light-footed stance which relies on leaps and acrobatics  
        to ensure that by the time your opponent makes their  
        attack, you've moved out of the way. 
{@BULL:{x   A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on  
        physical power. 
 
Once you are in a stance, you can type 'sskill' to see how skilled 
you are in that particular stance and what your percentage is.  This  
only works when you are in that stance.

0 STORY~
Walking along the beaten path you stumble, out of energy, out of breathe and out
of food. You are set on reaching your destination. You look up to the sky and
take a rough guess that it's only another days walking, but you know you can't
go that long without food or water. You scan your surroundings and spot a
cottage about fifty paces off the treaded path and start to walk towards it.
   As you approach the cottage you realize that the foliage blocks out more sun
then you thought, but the cold air and cool breeze are more then welcoming. You
look at the cottage and you come to the conclusion that no one has been here in
quite a few years. As you look at the house you don't really see any sign of
rotting but anyone can tell its kept standing by magic. You look around and from
a rather small window you see a faint light coming from inside the house and
your hopes of nourishment are renewed. As you leap over the thick foliage
surrounding the cottage the door opens and an old lady steps out of the door,
and seems rather irritated at you.
   "Why do thou bother me?" she snarls at you.
   "I am a weary traveler and have run out of food and drink. I was in hopes you
had some to spare," you reply shakily.
   "I barely have enough food for myself let alone every traveler that comes
along that path with the same story. However, for fifty gold I will transport
you to your destination," she replies sternly.
   "Thats all my gold though!" you yell in shock.
   "That is my fee. Take it or be gone with you," she snaps back.
   You sit down for a minute and think about the offer, and then decide it will
save you the time to walk and agree. You toss her your coin purse and she
promptly opens it and starts counting the gold.
   "Very good, where are you going?" she asks you calmly.
   "Midgaard," is all you say.
   She gasps and looks back at you and nods slowly, and tosses your coin purse
at you. 
   As you look at her confused, she starts chanting, and then stops.
   "You will need that gold more then me if it is Midgaard you are going to. May
your god have mercy on you."
    She looks to the ground for a minute in deep concentration, looks directly
at you and utters the word, 'hzrzsafh'.
    You come to several hours later and somehow you still have your money, and
you are indeed in the town of Midgaard, but are not quit sure why she gave you
your coin purse back.

1 noteedit~
After you make your subject for the note (Idea, etc), and the recipiants,
you want, type note edit.  This will bring you into 'Append mode'.  While
in this mode, almost anything you type will be put in the note, and not be
recongnised by the mud.

Typing 'ooc Hi!' will only make a line in the note that says ooc Hi!.

Finish the text of your note without sending any other commands (note
show, note +, ect.) and type '.s'.  This 'dot' command will
show you your note.  If it looks good, then type '.f'.  This will format
your note so it will make a return every 80 character.  Thus, making it
look nice and even.  If you're done, type @ and you will leave append
mode.
 
Significant commands used while in append mode:
 .s                            Shows the note
 .f                            Formatts the note.
 .c                            Clears the note.
 .ld <Number>                  Deletes that particular line of text.
 .lr <Number> <Line of Text>   Replaces the line number with the given line.
 .li <Number> <Line of Text>   Inserts the line of text at that particular
 line number
 @                             Removes you from append mode.

0 skin~

0 focus~
Syntax: Focus
Syntax: Train 'Focus Name'
 
Characters, after reaching legendship, can train further in their abilities.
This training has two parts.  First, the character goes to their guildmaster
where preliminary training is given.  Afterward, they have to go and gain
experience in the normal fashion.  When the person gains enough experience
in a particular focus, they gain a focus level and gain stat bonuses.
 
The bonuses are like this:
Combat Strength:    Damroll/Strength
Combat Defense:     AC/Movement
Combat Agility:     Hitroll/Dexterity
Combat Toughness:   HP/ Con
Magic Power:        Sorcery Bonus
Magic Ability:      Mana/Int
Magic Defense:      Saves/Wis
 
25,000 Xp is needed to gain the first level.  After that, needed xp goes
up by 15%.  There is no limit to the number of levels that can be gained.
