Distorted Illusions v2.5b2 is the evolution of the mud formerly known as Asgardian Nightmare. It is a stable, VERY heavily modified RoT1.4 with OLC. This mud was one of the first, if not the first to introduce a Random Item Generator like Diablo II. The code for the Random Generator was written in 1996 by Tas (Chris Langlois) and (Gavorkian) Gabe Volker. This code boasts a Focus system, Automated Quest and Stock Market, unique multi-auction system, unique/random item generation, an almost completely original MASSIVE multi-continent worlds, OLC, hundreds of MobProg quests, every immortal command you could ever possibly need, and much, much more. The credit for this code is as follows:
Asgardian Nightmare 1.5b2 by Tas, Tien, Gavorkian, Kefka, and Skyntil.(1996-2002)
Distorted Illusions 1.0 by Callin (2002-2004)
Distorted Illusions 2.0 by Bree (2005-2007)
Distorted Illusions 2.5b2 by Bree and Fesdor (2008-2009)
This code compiles clean with 3 warnings on GCC4
