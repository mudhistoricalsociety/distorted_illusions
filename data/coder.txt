These are the things I'm considering coding:
1) If you recall in troy/dark continent it will recall you to dark continent.
2) Getting bounty to work for anyone to collect.
3) Having bless and curse do opposite effects (but good for that align)
4) Armor hindrance (not sure how this would work)

Or we could calculate based off existing AC, where more AC would probably havea higher
encumbrance. Then you could take wear location inot account and say thata bracelet
borbably hinders movement less than bulky leggings or some huge platemail.
Or we could calculate based off weight.  I would vote this option except it would mean
that builders would need to start adding real weight values to most existing eq, as most
eq tha people wear either weighs 0 or 1.

I could see it affecting chance to hit/dodge, moves required
to do stuff, hunger/thirst, hiding/sneaking, being able to channel magical energy,
maximum amount of hinderance, perhaps?
* What also could go with this is a skill to reduce hindrance for certain classes.

We then have to keep in mind that we don't want this to be so outrageous that someone
has to chose between having -200 AC and being able to backstab and sneak around, or
having -800 and being able to do nothing but regular attacks with a circle here and
there or be failing at spells 1/3 of the time.  I use thieves as the example because
i see them getting hit the hardest by this change.  Them and mages.  Warriors are
too 1-dimensional, all they do is damage with the occasional lunge or twirl or kick.

I'm invisioning small, barely noticable changes...people see though their hide a bit
more than before, a spell that usually succeeds might fail or do less damage than normal.
Lunge might miss more, or a warrior misses a few more attacks than normal.  Not huge,
monsterous, mega super noticable changes that cause people to reroll because their class
now sucks.

5) Kick damage based on foot gear's weight? damageroll?
6) Removing bugs.
